# STIsim

STIsim is an agent-based modeling framework in which users can design and configure simulations of sexually-transmitted diseases. STIsim uses the [Starsim](https://starsim.org) architecture, and belongs to the Starsim model suite which also includes [Covasim](https://covasim.org), [HPVsim](https://hpvsim.org), and [FPsim](https://fpsim.org).

## Requirements

Python 3.9–3.13.

We recommend, but do not require, installing STIsim in a virtual environment, such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products).

## Installation

STIsim is most easily installed via PyPI: `pip install stisim`.

STIsim can also be installed locally. Clone this repository, then run `pip install -e .` (don't forget the dot at the end!).

## Usage and documentation

Documentation is available at [https://docs.idmod.org/projects/stisim](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/stisim).
